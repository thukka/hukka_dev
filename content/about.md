## About me

I'm a Bachelor of Business Administration with a specialization in IT infrastructure. I have a lot of experience in the IT sector such as local IT support, service desk, 2nd tier support specialist and customer coordinator. Currently I'm working as a Cloud Trainee at CGI.

When I'm not in front of a computer I'm probably hanging out with my friends, binge-watching TV shows & movies or planning to adopt a dog.
