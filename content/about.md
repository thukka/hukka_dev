## About me

I'm a Bachelor of Business Administration with a specialization in IT infrastructure. I have a lot of experience in the IT sector such as local IT support, service desk, 2nd tier support specialist and customer coordinator.

Two years ago while working and doing my BBA studies I started to seriously consider coding. I picked up [Helsinki University's Java MOOC](https://java-programming.mooc.fi/) and haven't looked back since. After completing [Full Stack Open 2021 (parts 0-9)](https://fullstackopen.com/en/) I was sure that web developing is the career I want to pursue. Since then I've been working on my own projects for my portfolio and just recently started to look for my first job in software/web development.

When I'm not in front of a computer I'm probably hanging out with my friends, binge-watching TV shows & movies or planning to adopt a dog.
