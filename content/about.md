## About me

I'm a Bachelor of Business Administration with a specialization in IT infrastructure. All my previous jobs have been in the IT sector: local IT support, service desk, 2nd tier support specialist and customer coordinator.

Two years ago while working and doing my BBA studies I wanted to give coding another try. I picked up [Helsinki University's Java MOOC](https://java-programming.mooc.fi/) and haven't looked back since. After completing [Full Stack Open 2021 (parts 0-9)](https://fullstackopen.com/en/) I felt strongly that web developing is the career I want to pursue. Since then I've been developing my own projects for my portfolio and just recently started to look for my first job in the developing field.

As a person I'm relaxed, social and easily approachable. I love learning new things and solving problems.
